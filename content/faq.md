# PHP.earth internal FAQ

This document will try to provide explanations and reasons why things work like
they do.

## Facebook group FAQ

The following questions and answers are related to a
[PHP Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204685680/).

### Why aren't group posts approved manually by admins?

Facebook groups have a feature where admins can approve posts before they appear
on the group timeline. Admins have already used this feature in the past and a
lot of communication loss occurred.

There is no option to comment on the post before approving it. Members also soon
started to ask questions why were some post approved and some not. Also, huge
time delays occurred on occassion to approve posts on time.

We will definitely test future changes by Facebook in this direction and we might
enable this one day though.

### Why not adding tags to the questions (for example, beginner, advanced, etc.)?

![Post tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php-earth/assets/master/images/content/faq-tags.png "Post tags")

A very good idea would be to add custom tags to questions. For example, to
categorize questions based on the skill level or context. However, Facebook
groups are not forums in the usual sense. Admins don't have options to edit
another user's post. Furthermore, asking every single member to add certain tag
would be very time consuming and opinionated, what is a *beginner* and what is
an *advanced* level question.

### Why not creating two or more groups?

Another very good and common idea would be to split the load between multiple
groups. However, managing such a large group takes a lot of volunteering time.
Our quality and codex standards would also require to properly sync different
teams of multiple groups properly, so for the time being, we will try to go with
a single monolithic group on Facebook.

### Why don't you pin post with the group rules and a PHP guide?

At the time of this writing, we have tried many types of pinned posts. On mobile
devices pinned posts are visible after another click elsewhere, so the
functionality is not the same as on the desktop.

Instead of pinning posts, we use multiple different approaches to inform group
members about the group rules.
