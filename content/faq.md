# PHP.earth internal FAQ

This document will provide additional explanations and reasons why things work
like they do and to avoid repeating answers. The following questions and answers
are related to a [PHP Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2204685680/)
and some of the PHP.earth inner workings.

## Why aren't posts approved manually by admins?

Facebook groups have a feature where admins can approve posts before they appear
on the group timeline. Admins have already used this feature in the past and a
lot of communication loss occurred.

There is no option to comment on the post before approving it. Members also soon
started to ask questions why were some post approved and some not. Also, huge
time delays occurred on occassion to approve posts on time.

We will definitely test future changes by Facebook in this direction and we might
enable this one day though.

## Why not adding tags to the posts (beginner, advanced, PHP, JavaScript, etc.)?

![Post tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php-earth/assets/master/images/content/faq-tags.png "Post tags")

A very good idea would be to add custom tags to questions. For example, to
categorize questions based on the skill level or context.

However, Facebook groups are not forums in the usual sense.

![Admin options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php-earth/assets/master/images/content/faq-admin-options.png "Admin options")

Admins don't have options to edit another user's post. Furthermore, asking every
single member to add certain tag would be very time consuming and opinionated
matter, what is a *beginner* and what is an *advanced* level question.

## Why not creating two or more groups?

Another very good and common idea would be to split the load between multiple
groups. However, managing such a large group takes a lot of volunteering time.
Our quality and codex standards would also require to properly sync different
teams of multiple groups properly, so for the time being, we will try to go with
a single monolithic group on Facebook.

## Why not pinning a post with the group rules or a PHP guide?

At the time of this writing, we have tried many types of pinned posts. On mobile
devices pinned posts are visible after another click elsewhere, so the
functionality is not the same as on the desktop.

Instead of pinning posts, we use multiple different approaches to inform group
members about the group rules.

## Why only English?

Facebook provides an automatic translation feature for some languages. In some
cases, it might seem like a good idea to allow discussions in other languages as
well. However, not all languages are properly supported by automatic translation
tool and some words would not be translated properly. For cases, where admin
actions would be required (insults, hate speech and similar), it would be
impossible to properly address such situations.

People in the group are located from all over the world, so English is a standard
language used for such cases.

However, PHP community provides and encourages all the support for linguistic
diversity for local user groups via 
[php.ug](https://php.ug), where you should join, support or add your
local user group with your preferred language.

## Why is sharing private data bad?

Sharing private data, especially emails, phone numbers, and similar contact data
is in general, a bad choice due to the fact of getting unsolicited promotion
materials (spam). Group administrators take privacy very seriously, therefore the
deletion of any contact details such as or emails or phone numbers without
research if it is for business purposes or private.

This is done for *two* main reasons: Avoiding spam and for educational purposes
of community members to raise awareness of the privacy importance online.

Facebook has a great and secure private messaging functionality, which you should
use instead of exchanging contact information publicly in comments.

Furthermore, requesting for the private data in most countries requires special
handling by the law and options to opt-out.
