# PHP.earth internal FAQ

This document will try to provide explainations and reasons why things work, like
they do.

## Facebook group FAQ

The following questions are related to a PHP.earth group on Facebook.

### Why aren't group posts approved manually by admins?

Facebook groups have a feature where admins can approve posts before they appear
on the group timeline. Admins have already trying to use this feature in the past
and as it turned out, a lot of communication loss occurred.

There is no option to comment on the post before approving it. Members soon
started to ask questions: why is some post approved and not the other. Also a huge
time delays occured on occassions to approve posts on time.

We will definitely test future changes by Facebook in this direction though and
we might enable this one day.

### Why not adding tags on the questions (for example `beginner`, `advanced`, etc)?

![Post tags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php-earth/assets/master/images/content/faq-post-approvals.png "Post tags")

A very good idea would be to add tags or hashtags on questions. For example, to
categorize questions based on the skill level, context and similar. However,
Facebook groups are not forums in the usual sense. Admins don't have options to
edit another user posts. Also asking every single member to add certain tag would
be time consuming and questionable, what is a *beginner* and what is *advanced*
level question.

### Why not creating two or more groups?

Another very good and common idea would be to split the load between multiple
groups. However, managing such a large group takes a lot of volunteering time.
Our quality and codex standards would also require to properly sync different
teams of multiple groups properly, so for the time being, we will try to go with
a single monolithic group on Facebook.

### Why don't you pin post with the group rules and a PHP guide?

At the time of this writing, we have tried many types of pinned posts. On mobile
devices pinned posts are visible after another click elsewhere, so the effect
and functionality is not the same as on desktop.

Instead of pinning posts, we use multiple different approaches to inform group
members about the group rules.
