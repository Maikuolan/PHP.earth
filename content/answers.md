# How to answer questions?

Online communities are based on people seeking knowledge, sharing knowledge and
asking questions.

To give something back to the community you are encouraged to help people the
way you can. However, not every answer is unfortunately helpful everytime.

## Introduction

This recommendation is the result of a long term observation of the group and
how people asking questions really feel. It is a summary of ideas and concepts
of how to improve the communication levels inside the group and the international
community.

This document recommends how to react as a community member to questions and to
provide the best possible experience as being a community member.

## Empathy

Beginners seeking knowledge and solutions to particular technical issues often
feel intimidated when surrounded with people who have been on the same path
before and who know more about the particular issue than them.

Imagine you get stuck at a particular issue where your knowledge cannot solve it
right away and this prevents you to continue. One way to get help on the task is
to ask the community. Using search engines works until you don't particularly
know what kind of a solution you are after or results are not understandable
enough for your knowledge level. Searching for something with insufficient
knowledge can many times feel like looking for a needle in a haystack.

Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings and situation of
someone else. Many people, specially programmers lack such ability to look at
the situation through the perspective of someone else. This is also results in
insuficient people skills.

Being rude is simple. Being kind and helpful can be sometimes difficult and you
need to train and learn such skills.

## How to give quality answers?

* Understandable and socially valuable communication is important.
* Recommendations must be researched. People will not learn from wrong advice.
* Find existing solutions which address the issue and give user links with
  additional explanations.
* Attitude is everything. Be nice and respectful to the one asking for help.
* For most questions asked only pointing to search engines such as Google is not
  a solution. It is inefficient and doesn't add any value of attraction to the
  response.
* Being sarcastic and rude to beginners is definitely a turn off.
* Demonstrate knowledge prior feelings.

## Why bothering?

* You will learn from the questions as well.
* You will be more motivated to study particular topic, as on your own.
* You are helping to raise the *awesome* factor of a particular community.
* Optionally, share the solutions also on your blog or contribute them to
  the particular documentation for future similar issues if they weren't there
  before.
* Being kind and helpful is very contagious. You will influence other community
  members through your behavior.
