# How to answer questions?

Online communities are based on people seeking knowledge, sharing knowledge and
asking questions.

To give something back to the community you are encouraged to help people the
way you can. However not every answer is unfortunately helpful everytime.

## Introduction

This recommendation is the result of a long term observation of the group and
how people asking questions really feel. It is a summary of ideas and concepts
of how to improve the communication levels inside the group and the international
community.

This document recommends how to react as a community member to questions and to
provide the best possible experience as being a community member.

## Empathy

Beginners seeking knowledge and solutions to particular technical issues often
feel intimidated when surrounded with people who have been on the same path
before and who know more about the particular issue than them.

Imagine you get stuck at a particular issue where your knowledge cannot solve it
right away and this prevents you to continue. One way to get help on the task is
to ask the community. Using search engines works until you don't particularly
know what kind of a solution you are after or results are not understandable
enough for your knowledge level.

## How to give quality answers?

* Understandable and socially valuable communication is important.
* Recommendations must be researched. People will not learn from wrong advice.
* Find existing solutions which address the issue and give user links with
  additional explanations.
* Attitude is everything. Be nice and respectful to the one asking for help.
* For most questions asked pointing to search engines such as Google is not a
  solution for the one asking a question. That is inefficient and doesn't add any
  value of attraction to the group. Also many times the searching for something
  on search engines with insufficient knowledge is like looking for a needle in
  a haystack.
* Being sarcastic and rude to beginners is definitely a turn off.
* Demonstrate knowledge prior feelings.

By answering you can also learn from the questions yourself on the way.
